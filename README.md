# Escape To Earth

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nightblade9/escape-to-earth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nightblade9/escape-to-earth)

Stealth rescue roguelite where you team up with others to escape to earth. Made with .NET Core, SadConsole, and GoRogue.

## Design Goals
- Deen: making du'a with specific names of Allah, which determine the (multiple) effects
- Educational: isolation kills you. You have to rescue others and work together to get out
- Gameplay: stealth (non-combat) roguelite; enemies with pattern walks; machinery, switches, puzzles, etc.

## Background and Setting
- Sci-Fi. We're enslaved by a new Firawn in 2150, we want to escape this prison planet to get back to Earth.
- Multiple dungeon visits. Retrieve the parts needed to build an escape pod or teleporter.
- Evacuate as many people as you can (irrespective of religion/race). So you need more ship/teleporter parts.
- We will need a secret base. There's no other way to sustainably stay hidden.

# Core Gameplay
- Trawl the dungeon. Sneak around. Don't fight.
- Rescue people. They go up to the hidden base.
- Utilize their unique skills to get farther. Rescue more.
- Find tech parts in the dungeon, enlist engineers, and we all go home eventually.
